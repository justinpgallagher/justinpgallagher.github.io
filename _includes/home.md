My Primary research field is environmental economics, with a broad interest in household finance,
labor economics, and public economics.  The central theme of my research is investigating how
individuals evaluate and respond to environmental risks.

Work in progress includes a project that examines how infrastructure externalities affect public
investment decisions. The work is supported by the National Science Foundation through
[NSF grant 1638320](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1638320&amp;HistoricalAwards=false).

Here is the abstract:

> _Improving the nutritional content of public school meals is a topic of intense policy interest.
A main motivation is the health of school children, and, in particular, the rising childhood
obesity rate. Medical and nutrition literature has long argued that a healthy diet can have a
second important impact: improved cognitive function. In this paper, we test whether offering
healthier meals affects student achievement as measured by test scores. Our sample includes all
California (CA) public schools over a five-year period. We estimate difference-in-difference style
regressions using variation that takes advantage of frequent meal-vendor contract turnover.
Students at schools that contract with a healthy school lunch vendor score higher on CA state
achievement tests. We do not find any evidence that healthier school meals lead to a
decrease in obesity rates. The test score gains, while modest in magnitude, come at very low cost._
