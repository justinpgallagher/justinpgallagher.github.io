Economic models and reasoning provide a valuable lens through which to view many of the most intractable and perplexing environmental problems. The objective of this class is to apply the tools of a typical introductory or intermediate microeconomics course to topics involving the natural environment. That is, we will view environmental topics from the perspective of an economist. Topics that will be covered in this class include: Market failure in the case of externalities and public goods provision, Management of renewable resources, Cost-effective pollution control, and Energy use and global climate change. We will take the tools from the classroom and apply them to the most pressing environmental problems including: Air and water pollution, Endangered species, Valuation of the natural environment, Fossil fuel use, and Business sustainability.
